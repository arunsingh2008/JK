Introduction
In this project, we aim to create an intelligent book management system using Python, a locally running Llama3 generative AI model, and cloud infrastructure. The system will allow users to perform various operations related to books, such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting books from a PostgreSQL database. Additionally, the system will generate summaries for books using the Llama3 model, provide book recommendations based on user preferences, manage user reviews, and generate rating and review summaries for books. The system will be accessible via a RESTful API and deployed on the cloud.

Requirements
This document outlines the requirements for the intelligent book management system project.

1. Database Setup
o Database Design
We will use PostgreSQL to store book information. The database will consist of two tables: books and reviews.

Books Table
The books table will have the following fields:

id: A unique identifier for each book.
title: The title of the book.
author: The author of the book.
genre: The genre of the book.
year_published: The year the book was published.
summary: A summary of the book's content.
Reviews Table
The reviews table will have the following fields:

id: A unique identifier for each review.
book_id: A foreign key referencing the id field in the books table.
user_id: A unique identifier for the user who wrote the review.
review_text: The content of the user's review.
rating: The rating given by the user (1-5).
2. Llama3 Model Integration
o Model Setup
We will use a locally running Llama3 generative AI model to generate summaries for books based on their content. We can choose from various models, such as O Llama 3, Hugging Face's Llama3 model, or Groq OLAMA Hugging face model.

o Model Integration
The Llama3 model will be integrated into the system to generate summaries for new book entries and review summaries for each book.

3. RESTful API
o API Endpoints
The system will provide the following RESTful API endpoints:

POST /books: Add a new book.
GET /books: Retrieve all books.
GET /books/<id>: Retrieve a specific book by its ID.
PUT /books/<id>: Update a book's information by its ID.
DELETE /books/<id>: Delete a book by its ID.
POST /books/<id>/reviews: Add a review for a book.
GET /books/<id>/reviews: Retrieve all reviews for a book.
GET /books/<id>/summary: Get a summary and aggregated rating for a book.
GET /recommendations: Get book recommendations based on user preferences.
POST /generate-summary: Generate a summary for a given book content.
4. Asynchronous Programming
o Asynchronous Operations
We will implement asynchronous operations for database interactions and AI model predictions using sqlalchemy[asyncio] and asyncpg.

5. Cloud Deployment
o Cloud Infrastructure
The application will be deployed on the cloud using services such as EC2, Lambda, or ECS.

o Database Hosting
The database will be hosted on AWS RDS.

o Model File Storage
If necessary, AWS S3 will be used to store model files.

o CI/CD Pipeline
A CI/CD pipeline will be set up for automatic deployment.

o Deployment Documentation
A deployment document will be shared as a Read Me file in the GitHub repository.

6. Authentication and Security
o Authentication
We will implement basic authentication for the API.

o Secure Communication
We will ensure secure communication with the database and API endpoints.

By following the requirements and guidelines outlined in this document, we will create a robust and scalable intelligent book management system.
